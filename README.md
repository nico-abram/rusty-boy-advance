- [This](https://onlinedisassembler.com/odaweb/) online disassembler that supports armv4t
- [This](http://shell-storm.org/online/Online-Assembler-and-Disassembler/) other online disassembler, which works better (The other one doesnt correctly respect the thumb setting all the time) and also has an assembler, but gets some opcodes wrong (Possibly because it's not specifically armv4)
